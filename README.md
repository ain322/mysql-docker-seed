# Mysql database seeding example

This project is a working example how to create a custom
mysql docker image that already has seed data.

This technique can be used for example in cases when you want to seed a lot of data once and then use the custom built mysql image later.


## Building and running

To see the whole thing in action, make sure docker is running and in the project's root folder simply execute:

`$ ./migration-test.sh`

**Note**: This is not meant to be used in production
